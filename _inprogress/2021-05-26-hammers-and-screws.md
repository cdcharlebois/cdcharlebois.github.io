# Hammers and Screws

They say that when you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a screw. As a change agent, it's important to remember that such a perception can remain burned in the retinas of your colleagues long after the tool itself has been replaced.

I've worked with the leading low code application development platform for about five years now. It that time, I've seen a lot of very successful projects, including a nationwide rollout of an application of an application to gather inventory information that went from idea to deployed application in about two months. I've seen&mdash;and worked with&mdash;customers who *get it*. And I've seen customers who don't.

One thing that all customers who *get it* understand is that buying a low code platform isn't going to magically transform your business into a nimble, digital enterprise, it's not that simple. There's often a lot of cruft in your way.

Low code is a tool. It might not solve *all* your problems, and it probably *shouldn't*, but when applied in the right way, with the right purpose and expectations, it can absolutely be a catalyst for your organization.

When bringing in a low code platform for a project or initiative, make sure that the support systems around the project have the right vision and sense of ownership/entrepreneurship to get the value out of it. For instance, I've seen customers get upset because they bought this shiny new low code platform, but they aren't seeing any value because the starting project they chose was way too big. They can't even measure/organize all the work that needs to be done in a coherent way. If you can't measure success, you can't expect success.
