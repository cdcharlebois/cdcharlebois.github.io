Hello there!

My name is Conner and I'm a Tech Lead at [Mendix](//www.mendix.com). I'm a competitive golfer in Philadelphia and a faithful fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club.

This blog is a place to share thoughts and tools to help makers everywhere drive innovation in their lives and workplaces through tips, tricks, and lessons that I've learned along the way.
